                    <p>Buffering issues are usually related to your internet connection or IPTV service quality. First,
                        check your internet speed (we recommend at least 10 Mbps for HD content). Try refreshing your
                        playlist from the Upload section. If the problem persists, contact your IPTV service provider as
                        the issue may be with their servers or stream quality.</p>

                        separately and you can easily switch between them from the Upload section. Simply select the
                        playlist you want to use and it will load all associated channels, movies, and series. You can
                        also refresh or delete playlists as needed.</p>
